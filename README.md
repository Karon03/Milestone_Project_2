# Somnus Sleep Tracker
Hello, and thank you for checking out our collaborative group project! Within this repository is our project, the Somnus Sleep Tracker.
The Somnus sleep tracker uses data that you input to calculate your sleep time and quality.

## What was your motivation?
Given a list of project choices, the one that stuck out to the group members of our project was making a sleep tracker. Everybody loves to get a quality night's sleep, and the concept of being able to make our own tracker that allows us to do so seemed like the most appealing idea to go for!


## Features for the Future.
There are quite a few features we'd like to touch up on or add in the future for this project, but due to time constraints, some of them had to be cut out of the current product and potentially added at a later date. One of the first ones that comes to mind is having the textfields function on the login/signup so that after using it redirects you to different pages and ability to insert data in the account page as well, Another feature would be showing like a sleep score which would showcase the quality of the sleep you had gotten that night was using the data inserted.
